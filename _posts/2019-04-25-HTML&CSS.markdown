This HTML CSS Book from Jon Duckett is pretty intuitive. It features a fresh new graphical way of learning something
that once was originally shown in plain text. It's got all sorts of examples too and a few snippets of real world
applications.

New Blog site still underway, but for now this github.io will do.
