Started a new section on recognizing the important of pattern matching expressions
in codes. Saves time, money, and adds workplace-value.

"Knowing [regular expressions] can mean the difference between solving a problem in 3 steps and solving it in 3000 steps. When you're a nerd (Which I might be), you forget that the problems you solve with a couple keystrokes can take other people days of tedious, error-prone work to slog through" - Cory Doctorow (Tech Writer)
<br>
This quote was taken directly from the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" book written by Al Sweigart.
<br>
Wrote a program that checks for phone numbers that follow the format ###-###-#### in a body of text to extract phone numbers. Won't post the code as that I believe belongs to the intellectual propery of Al Sweigart. However as a message to myself "It's saved on your GitHub if you need it!".
