Just now a collaborator of mine suggested a keywork called 'GitHub Desktop'.
<br>
Needless to say I'm pretty blown away with this application. Gone are the days that I visit the website link! All I need is this desktop application now suckas! 
<br>
Nah, nothing is going to replace the website. But this desktop application is sleek and seems quite robust. It's got settings for everything I need. A simple click and drag into my local disk drive repository pings the desktop application to commit changes and push to origin. 
<br>
I'm no master of Git yet, but I know I will be as I progress through this journey. Climb with me.
