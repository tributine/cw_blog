I'm going to challenge myself by writing a script that takes a 'string' and returns the string printed backwards.

It's going to require me to:  <br>
1 - Set up a string to copy  <br> 
2 - Identify each different character in the string (learn to iterate through the string) <br>  
3 - Assign the iterated strings from highest to lowest. (ex. 5:0) to simulate 'backwards'  <br>

Potential ideas:  <br>
Use pyperclip.paste() to take a string from the clipboard. When the python code is executed, using <br>  
pyperclip.copy() it will allow the user to simply paste the backwards string in any text document.  <br>
